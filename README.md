# Starpost
A hugo blog post manager I made for my website.

## Why
I was disappointed that there wasn't an app where I could simply write posts for my blog more efficiently. Most of them had some weird, cringe-worthy 'git' integration that connected to a server or something. This is a local app that manages static markdown and images for you.

## Disclaimer

I've only ever used this on my own site, I will not add support for your site if you use this. Keep that in mind.
