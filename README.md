# Starpost
A hugo blog post manager I made for my website.

## Why
I was disappointed from there not being an app where I can just write posts for my blog more efficiently. Mostly all of them did some weird cringe "git" shit where they would connect to a server or something. This is a local app that manages static markdown and images for you.
